# ApiHelp

Things that help you consume the Practice Engine APIs

Our Api has a help page (/PE/ApiHelp) and Swagger* support (/PE/swagger) to help you.  Sometimes you just need/want something more.  In this repository we will provide some different tools (such as Postman Collections).

* *Swagger support has been added and will be included in an upcoming release*
